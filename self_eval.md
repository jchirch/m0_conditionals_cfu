# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    - 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - Read all the README.md's first to complete tasks in correct order.
    - The comparisons.rb file was pretty full of printed lines. I'd break up the sections by including lines of code to break up sections like `puts "PART 3: Logical Operators"`
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    - I got a code challange right on the first try. That rarely happens at this stage of my learning.
    - I was able to complete most of the tasks by memory and rarely referenced my notes.
    - forking, cloning, and pushing edited repos went very smoothly.
    - I'm most satisfied with how much progress has been made this first week at Turing compared to my attempts to self teach myself over the last few months!
